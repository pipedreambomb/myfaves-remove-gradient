# myfaves-remove-gradient
Remove the gradient (aka shading) from myfav.es, because there's no option for "no gradient", for some reason.

It just applies a single rule of CSS to a single web page, as you will see in the code here. Made it open source for reassurance, as extensions can be kinda sketchy!
